                        Hi there! I'm Emmanuel Leakono. I am deeply passionate about building software that addresses real-world challenges. My journey in software engineering began during my early education, where my interest in technology and problem-solving naturally drew me to programming. This interest grew significantly when I joined Moringa School, where I spent intensive months sharpening my skills in full-stack development. Through this program, I developed a solid foundation in web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Python. I also gained hands-on experience with Git for version control and collaborative coding, database management, and building REST APIs to connect and enhance applications. Moringa Schoolâ€™s emphasis on practical, team-based, and challenging projects taught me how to build scalable and efficient applications that solve complex problems. Today, I am dedicated to leveraging my technical skills and collaborating with other innovators to create impactful software solutions. My ultimate goal is to push the boundaries of technology, contributing to applications that drive both innovation and success.
